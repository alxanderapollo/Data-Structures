Little Fly Thy summer's play, my thoughtless hand has brush'd away.
Am not I a fly like thee?
Or art not thou A man like me?
For I dance And drink And sing;
Till some blind hand Shall brush my wing.
If thought is life and strength and breath;
And the want of thought is death;
Then am I A happy fly, If I live, Or if I die.
